### Technology Considerations:

- **Database**: Use a relational database (like SQL Server or PostgreSQL) with Entity Framework Core for data management.

- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to ensure functionality.
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
